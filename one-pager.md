### 2. Laser Communication Module

**Solving RF Limitations in Orbit**  
RF communication is hitting limits: crowded spectrum, licensing hurdles, large antennas, low bandwidth, and high power demands make it suboptimal for small, data-intensive satellites.

**Our Solution:** A compact laser transmitter that brings optical performance to CubeSat scale.
- **Form Factor:** Fits in 0.3U (~3×10×10 cm) — compatible with 1U–3U platforms
- **High Throughput, Low Cost:** Uses impulse laser diode with collimation optics for high-throughput downlinks at low cost
- **Easy Pointing:** Tolerates ~5 mrad accuracy (typical tolerance for narrow-beam optical communication systems is less than 1 mrad) — no bulky galvos or PAT systems required
- **Power Efficient:** Consumes <10 W with minimal heat generation

Our system delivers the performance of classical optical downlink systems — without their complexity or cost.

### 3. Current Mission – _Puchacz (2026)_

Our 2U CubeSat, **Puchacz**, launches in Q2–Q3 2026 to demonstrate autonomous satellite pointing with laser downlink in LEO (520–550 km).  
It integrates:
- A **spectral imaging payload** 
- A **miniaturized laser downlink**
- A precision **ADCS system** for autonomous pointing and link acquisition

Puchacz validates end-to-end optical communication from a nanosatellite — proving both the hardware and operational flow in orbit.

### 4. Next Mission – _Swarm Laser Demonstrator (Q3-Q4 2027)_

We propose a **sponsor-backed mission** of our system aboard a 2U deployer carrying **four 0.5U CubeSats**.

**Mission Highlights:**
- <3 cm laser module height, **PC104-compatible**
- Planned support for **Cubesat Space Protocol** for standardized onboard communication
- Hybrid comms for mission reliability: **laser for downlink**, **RF for two way TT&C**
- Deployed in **Sun-synchronous LEO (~500 km)**
- Validates scalability across multiple nodes

**Market Opportunity:**
- CubeSat market: $1.6B by 2033 (16.3% CAGR)
- Laser comms: $36B by 2034 (45.4% CAGR)

**Value Proposition**
- Early advantage in an emerging, growing laser communication market
- Pioneering miniaturized laser tech for CubeSats, enabling scalable, high-bandwidth satellite downlinks for imaging payloads
- Commercial opportunities thanks to PC104 compatibility
